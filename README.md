## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

- See the demo : [Demo](https://compassionate-jones-233d26.netlify.app/)

- That's my second challenge of the Responsive Web Developper module. I really enjoyed building this team page and find the best way to make it responsive with the knowledge I have with CSS and HTML, I am looking forward to improve my skill with others challenges :).

- I used CSS grid to master the page but I think I could improve it just using CSS flexbox. Also, I heard about "mobile first" developement and I will try for futur projects.
